|Summary|
=========

This repository contains the FastMath library.  The primary functions are defined in ./src/FastMath.cpp and ./src/FastNumInt.cpp.  The latter makes use of GSL numerical integration functions.  A static library may be created in ./lib with the command 'make lib', assuming the object files already have been created in ./obj.  The binary executablesin the ./bin folder, titled 'BenchFastMath' and 'BenchFastNumInt' provide quantitative information on the speed and precision of each function defined in this repository.
